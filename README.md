# Rule-based out of disribution detection
This repository contains useful codes to reproduce the DNS results of the paper work **G.De Bernardi, S.Narteni, E.Cambiaso, M.Mongelli (2023) "Rule based out of distribution detection"** submitted to journal of IEEE transaction on artificial intelligence.
# Structure 
- Real data of DNS problem considering the two different protocols ssh and p2p
- DNS_ssh_falsi.xlsx: histograms obtained considering protocol ssh 
- DNS_p2p_falsi.xlsx: histograms obtained considering protocol p2p 
- DNS_p2p_DNS_ssh.xlsx: a mix of histograms obtained considering both protocols 
- DNS_base_line_ranges: histograms considering protocol p2p to create the baseline range
